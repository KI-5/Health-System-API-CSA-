# Health-System-API-CSA-
## Overview
The **Health System API** is a backend solution designed to streamline and manage healthcare services. Built using **JAX-RS** (Java API for RESTful Web Services), the API adheres to REST principles, ensuring scalability, modularity, and maintainability. It supports efficient management of patients, doctors, appointments, medical records, prescriptions, and billing.
